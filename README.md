# Sovereign Debt Risk Orchestration Pipeline

### Overview
This repository contains a Python-driven analytical pipeline developed as part of my MBA research at Berlin International University. It replaces manual, relationship-driven macroeconomic reporting with a predictable, software-like orchestration of international debt data.

### The Problem vs. The Solution
The Manual State: Macroeconomic indicators from the IMF and World Bank are often siloed, requiring thousands of manual interventions to normalize and compare.
The Orchestrated State: This pipeline automates the ingestion, cleaning, and empirical validation of "Black Swan" event indicators (Greece 2009 vs. Argentina).

### Technical Capabilities
Data Ingestion SOP: Handles heterogeneous CSV structures from international financial portals.
Wide-to-Long Orchestration: Automates the 'melting' of multi-decade time-series data for real-time analysis.
Empirical Modeling: Utilizes OLS Regression to test the Debt Overhang Theory and Financial Contagion risks.
Executive Visualization: High-fidelity plotting using Seaborn/Matplotlib for decision support.

### Why this matters for Operations Leadership
This project demonstrates my ability to:
1.  Digitize Workflows: Turning raw data into actionable insights.
2.  Ensure Reliability: Using modular code to handle edge cases in data reporting.
3.  Bridge Technology & Finance:Translating complex engineering-style data pipelines into business risk assessments.
